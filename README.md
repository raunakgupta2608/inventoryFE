# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### About Inventory App
The app is intended to list all the available items in the inventory at any point in time.
The app involves basic functionalities login and registration. While registering one has to register with either of the roles which is manager or assistant.

Once logged in depending on the role the dashboard will be shown.
The manager has access to add/edit/delete the items in the inventory, while the assistant can only view them.

### Project Structure
index.js is the file from where the whole application bootstraps.
App.js has the entry of all the routes.

App.css and index.css are the CSS files for regular styling.

utils(folder)
It has the axios.js file where the axios is configured.

context(folder)
The project involves the use of context API to share data across the application.
globalContext.js file has the context configured.
GlobalState.js has all the states that are shared across the application. Ex (Users and inventory details.) 

commonControls (folder)
It has all the components that can be used across the application like Input field, Radio Button field, Grid and the loader component.

components (folder)
Application specific components are mentioned in the components folder.

mocks (folder)
This folder is specific to unit testing, mock servers and handlers for the mock service workers are mentioned here.

__test__ (folder)
This folder has all the unit test files.

jest.config.js and setupTest.js are a few other files which helps in configuring uni tests.
